# Next Steps: Data Platform Improvements (Aligned with *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*)

This document outlines actionable next steps for your data platform, inspired by best practices and patterns from Martin Kleppmann‚Äôs *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*. Each section includes why it matters, what to implement, and where to integrate it in your platform and documentation.

## 1. Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) & Error Budgets

**Why it matters:**  
Clear SLOs and SLIs (e.g., percentile tail-latency, durability) provide objective reliability targets. Error budgets empower teams to balance reliability with innovation.

**Action Items:**
- Create SLO definitions (e.g., in `slos.yml`)
- Instrument jobs/services to expose SLIs (metrics, `/metrics` endpoints)
- Add CI validation for `slos.yml` and dummy metrics
- Configure Prometheus alerts and Grafana dashboards for SLOs
- Implement a deployment gating script using remaining error budget
- Write a runbook: editing SLOs, interpreting dashboards, emergency steps

**Where to add:**  
New ‚ÄúReliability‚Äù or ‚ÄúOperational Excellence‚Äù chapter in docs.

## 2. Schema Evolution & Compatibility Guarantees

**Why it matters:**  
Long-lived data systems must evolve schemas without breaking producers or consumers. Backward/forward compatibility (Avro, Protobuf) enables independent evolution.

**Action Items:**
- Deploy & configure Schema Registry
- Define Avro/Protobuf schemas with BACKWARD compatibility
- Add CI validation for schema compatibility
- Add producer/consumer code snippets pointing at registry
- Document compatibility rules & change guidelines

**Where to add:**  
‚ÄúData Modeling‚Äù or ‚ÄúSerialization‚Äù section.

## 3. Exactly-Once Processing & Idempotence

**Why it matters:**  
At-least-once delivery can cause duplicates; exactly-once semantics require idempotent writes or coordinated checkpoints‚Äîcritical for financial/billing pipelines.

**Action Items:**
- Enable Kafka producer idempotence settings
- Configure Spark checkpointing for EXACTLY_ONCE
- Use idempotent DB upserts (e.g., `ON CONFLICT` in Postgres)
- Document patterns and caveats

**Where to add:**  
‚ÄúStreaming Best Practices‚Äù section.

---

## 4. Distributed Consensus & Leader Election

**Why it matters:**  
DIY coordination (for locks, metadata) is brittle. Use proven consensus/coordination primitives for reliability.

**Action Items:**
- If distributed coordination is needed, consider integrating a lightweight solution (e.g., Zookeeper, already present for Kafka).
- Document coordination patterns and examples relevant to your stack.

**Where to add:**  
‚ÄúInfrastructure‚Äù or ‚ÄúCoordination & Metadata‚Äù chapter.

---

## 5. Backpressure & Flow Control in Stream Processors

**Why it matters:**  
Without backpressure, slow consumers or spikes can cause OOM or deadlocks. Reactive pull and buffer tuning prevent pipeline stalls.

**Action Items:**
- Tune Kafka Streams buffer and idle settings (if using Kafka Streams)
- Tune Spark streaming/batch memory and buffer configs
- Document parameters and provide a flow-control diagram

**Where to add:**  
‚ÄúStreaming Best Practices‚Äù alongside checkpointing.

---

## 6. Chaos Engineering for Data Pipelines

**Why it matters:**  
Complex data stacks have many moving parts. Controlled fault injection (network, node, disk) reveals brittle dependencies before production incidents.

**Action Items:**
- Add chaos-toolkit workflows (JSON experiments)
- Add a CI stage to run chaos tests
- Document a list of failure scenarios and lessons learned

**Where to add:**  
‚ÄúTesting & Validation‚Äù section.

---

## 7. Event Sourcing & CQRS Patterns

**Why it matters:**  
Capturing state changes as an immutable event log enables auditability, time-travel, and flexible materialized views. CQRS separates command and query workloads for scalability.

**Action Items:**
- Organize repo: `/events`, `/projections`, `/api`
- Define event JSON schemas
- Provide projection templates (apply functions)
- Document when/how to use event sourcing & CQRS

**Where to add:**  
‚ÄúArchitectural Patterns‚Äù section.

---

## 8. Observability: Distributed Tracing & Data Lineage

**Why it matters:**  
End-to-end visibility (metrics, logs, traces, lineage) is essential for root cause analysis and governance.

**Action Items:**
- Install OpenTelemetry SDK in each image
- Instrument code for tracing spans
- Configure lineage backend in Airflow (e.g., Spline, already present)
- Document a checklist for metrics, logs, traces, and lineage

**Where to add:**  
Across ‚ÄúMonitoring‚Äù and ‚ÄúGovernance‚Äù sections.

---

## 9. (Optional) Explore Advanced Topics

- **Kappa vs Lambda architectures:** Document trade-offs and migration strategies.
- **CRDTs & conflict resolution:** For geo-distributed stores, add examples and patterns.
- **Adaptive query optimization:** Summarize techniques in analytical engines.
