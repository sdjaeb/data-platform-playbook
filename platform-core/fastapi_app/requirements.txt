# fastapi_app/requirements.txt
# This file lists the Python dependencies for the FastAPI application.
# It includes standard web framework libraries and OpenTelemetry SDK components
# for instrumenting the application to emit telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces).
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn==0.24.0.post1
python-dotenv==1.0.0
kafka-python==2.0.2
pydantic==2.5.3 # Pinning for compatibility
opentelemetry-api==1.22.0
opentelemetry-sdk==1.22.0
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0 # For exporting OTLP metrics, logs, traces
opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi==0.43b0 # For auto-instrumenting FastAPI
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests==0.43b0 # For auto-instrumenting HTTP requests made by app
opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws==2.0.0 # Potentially useful for AWS environment, but not strictly needed for local
opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0 # Provides a convenient way to install core OpenTelemetry components
opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging==0.43b0 # For auto-instrumenting Python's logging module
opentelemetry-sdk-metrics==1.22.0 # Required for custom metrics, specifically histogram and counter
# The Kafka-Python library is not directly instrumented by OpenTelemetry out-of-the-box for producers.
# For full end-to-end tracing including Kafka production, manual instrumentation or a custom
# instrumentation library would be needed. This example focuses on FastAPI's HTTP layer and custom metrics.
